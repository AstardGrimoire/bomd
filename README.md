BOMD + DA is a mod adding new systems to the base game, revolving around adding intricate and uniquely designed encounters. The base AI of these encounters include Scaling
for multiplayer settings, Resetting for QoL purposes, Fluid and intricate animations, Attack management system that takes in the targets location, health, speed, and actions
with proper responses as counters. Allowing for unique and a "fresh breath of air" from the mundane and boring encounters added by vanilla. Whether it be through the presentation
and design of the bosses, or through the attack pattern and flow, BOMD + DA sets itself as one of the hidden gems of modding.
